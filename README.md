- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @markswoods
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Decision Models, particularly The Decision Model, but also Decision Model Notation.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning enough Python to reconstruct a Decision Model from a json representation, both to analyze and, hopefully, execute the logic. I am also interested in Node-Red and using it in conjunction with Tasker on Android and Amazon Alexa to facilitate Home Automations.
